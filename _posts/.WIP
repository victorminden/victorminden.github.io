### CFFI: the C Foreign Function Interface

## Parting thoughts

- There are way too many different ways to bring other languages (well, mostly C/C++) into Python, and it is not entirely clear wheh to use each.  The guidelines that I have heard are to stick with native extensions if performance is a concern and otherwise to use SWIG or gRPC services as is convenient.  However, it would be great to see a more fuller justification for this and some benchmarks.

- There is another route forward for Python-without-Python that has been generating buzz on the internet, namely Mojo ðŸ”¥.  I have not played too much with Mojo ðŸ”¥ at this stage, but it might be worth a dedicated post in the future once I understand it better.

- Something about [garfield minus garfield](https://garfieldminusgarfield.net/)
