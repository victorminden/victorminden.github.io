I am a fifth-year PhD student at the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)) at Stanford University, where I work with [Lexing Ying](http://math.stanford.edu/~lexing/).  My research concerns fast algorithms for scientific computing, in particular fast linear algebra on rank-structured matrices.

More broadly, my research interests include:

- numerical linear algebra
- numerical optimization
- signal processing
- spectral graph theory
- high-performance computing

Previously, I did my undergraduate work in mathematics and electrical engineering at [Tufts University](http://www.tufts.edu/), where my advisors were [Scott MacLachlan](http://www.math.mun.ca/~smaclachlan/) and [Douglas Preis](http://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/people/preis.htm).

My funding is generously provided by the Department of Energy (DOE) through the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship program ([CSGF](http://www.krellinst.org/csgf/)).  Through them, I have had the opportunity to work at a number of DOE research laboratories:

- Argonne National Laboratory (summer 2010 with the [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) team)
- Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (summer 2012 with the [computational mathematics](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/computational-mathematics-group.php) group through the [Cyber Defenders](https://cyberdefender.llnl.gov/) program)
- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (summer 2014 with [ANAG](http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/applied-mathematics/ANAG/))
